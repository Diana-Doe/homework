## Project name: SmartHome analysis
The site from which I take data -- [SmartHome](https://www.smarthomedb.com/products).
## Description
The program takes data from the [web-site](https://www.smarthomedb.com/products, 'SmartHome'), stores them in ADT and builds graphs.
<br>Since the site from which I take information is not large I do not use a web spider.
